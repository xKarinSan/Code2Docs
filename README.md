🕰️ What We Previously Built
Before pivoting to the CLI, Code2Docs was originally a web-based SaaS platform. It offered similar core features with a visual interface for generating and managing documentation.

We learned a lot from the initial version — especially around dev workflows and where automation adds real value — which led to the current CLI pivot.
